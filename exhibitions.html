              <h3>Cosmology</h3>
              <p>
                Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
                ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see
                and know about the universe around us.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be
                seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the
                stars to travel by.
              </p>
              <p>
                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
                traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of
                the planets in our solar system.

            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <p>
              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
              question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
              framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
              know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
              meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our
              Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

            <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
            <p>
              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
              biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
              the tiny world.
            </p>
            <p>
              For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
              quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
              understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore
              the history of medicine and take a look at some major
              breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first
              heart transplant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from
              the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our
              fellow creatures have beat us to it.

            <h3>Robotics and AI</h3>
            <p>
              The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
              intelligence are the science of the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of
              robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the
              hand of Rob the Robot.

            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <p>
              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
              planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how
              to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the
              whole planet.
